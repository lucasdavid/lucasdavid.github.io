  description: |-
    A comparative analysis of multiple convolutional networks-based strategies to identify and classify art-related digital
    artifacts. In a first stage, we conduct our experiments over the VGDB2016 dataset, comprising art pieces from Vincent
    van Gogh and his peers. We then expand our strategy to a broader multi-class scenario, seeking to distinguish paintings
    from 1,584 different authors.
