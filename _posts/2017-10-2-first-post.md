I'm glad you are here! :-)

When I first started to blog, in 2015, I had written some articles on
Software Engineer and design patterns. Unfortunately, I had to stop for a while
mainly because of grad school. However, I'm no longer taking or giving any
lectures and I'll be able to focus on this once again. I'll try to add those
old posts of mine here and, hopefully, a few new ones on Machine Learning.
